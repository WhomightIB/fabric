v3.1.3 Release Notes - October 18, 2025
=====================================


Improvements and Fixes
----------------------

The commit 77db242af51f496a1529b66d3022efad286a5f2d removed `sampleconfig/msp` from the orderer docker image,
and as a result orderers deployed with docker built from the image failed to run due to a mounting error.
Fixed by explicitly adding the config files in commit bbd9ca7dcdc09f49bc60725a6095b1bb7c212a14.

Dependencies
------------
Fabric v3.1.3 has been tested with the following dependencies:
* Go 1.25.2
* CouchDB v3.4.2

Fabric docker images on docker.io and ghcr.io utilize Ubuntu 24.04.


Changes and Removals
--------------------

See the [v3.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for changes and removals between Fabric v2.x and Fabric v3.x.


Deprecated features
-------------------

**Block dissemination via gossip is deprecated and may be removed**

Block dissemination via gossip is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
Fabric peers can be configured to receive blocks directly from an ordering service
node, and not gossip blocks, by using the following configuration:
```
peer.gossip.orgLeader: true
peer.gossip.useLeaderElection: false
peer.gossip.state.enabled: false
peer.deliveryclient.blockGossipEnabled: false
```
