v3.1.2 Release Notes - October 13, 2025
=====================================


Improvements and Fixes
----------------------

1. Config update can now be submitted through the channel participation API via a PUT that sends the config update as a multipart/form-data to /participation/v1/channels. The osnadmin tool has been updated accordingly, both contributions from @pfi79.
2. The channel participation API can now be used to fetch blocks, courtesy of @pfi79.
3. BFT orderers can now have their enrollment certificates rotated without requiring a config update as long as the public keys remain the same.  Feature contributed by @dviejokfs.
4. TLS Timeshift has been added to the channel participation API, implemented by @pfi79.

------------
Fabric v3.1.2 has been tested with the following dependencies:

Deprecated features

**Block dissemination via gossip is deprecated and may be removed**

Block dissemination via gossip is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.

peer.gossip.state.enabled: false
peer.deliveryclient.blockGossipEnabled: false
```
